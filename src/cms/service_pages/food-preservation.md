  From your first peas in the spring to your last pumpkin in the fall, your
  garden will keep you well-fed all throughout the growing season. But what
  about those cold months when you're not growing a garden? Wouldn't it be nice
  to keep on enjoying the harvest when there's snow on the ground?


  Even a small kitchen garden will provide you with plenty to eat now and plenty to preserve and enjoy later. Denver Kitchen Gardens offers food preservation workshops so our clients can fully benefit from the hard work they have put into their gardens.
