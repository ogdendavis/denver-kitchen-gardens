questions:
  - question: What areas do you service?
    answer: Denver Kitchen Gardens works with clients throughout the Denver-Metro
      area. Please [contact me](/contact) if you live outside this range to see
      how we can work together.
  - question: Are you a landscaper?
    answer: Denver Kitchen Gardens specializes in growing food, not landscape
      design. Fortunately, there are lots of wonderful sustainable landscapers
      in Denver that I can recommend.
  - question: Do you  offer installations?
    answer: While I do not plant your garden for you, I can help you at planting
      time with my Garden Coaching servies. I love hands-on learning!
  - question: How much do your services cost?
    answer: Great question! Please [contact me](/contact) to discuss your project
      and I can provide an estimate.
  - question: Do you offer full service garden management?
    answer: Sorry, no. I'm a one-woman show and am unable to tend your garden while
      you are on vacation.
