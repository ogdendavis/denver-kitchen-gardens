      services are great for folks who could use a little help with issues or
      edible garden design.

      area. Please [contact me](/contact) if you live outside this range to see
      how we can work together.
  - question: Are you a landscaper?

      design. Fortunately, there are lots of wonderful sustainable landscapers
      in Denver that I can recommend.

      I can provide an estimate.
  - question: How much do your services cost?
    answer: Great question! Please [contact me](/contact) to discuss your project
      and I can provide an estimate.
  - question: Do you offer full service garden management?
    answer: Sorry, no. I'm a one-woman show and am unable to tend your garden while
      you are on vacation.
  - question: What the heck is a kitchen garden?
    answer: This is a space dedicated to growing fruits, veggies, herbs and flowers
      for home cooking. Your curated kitchen garden is where you grow the foods
      you love the most, usually close to your kitchen for convenience and
      inspiration!
