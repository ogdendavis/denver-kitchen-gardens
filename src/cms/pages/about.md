title: Sharing a love of food and flowers
hero_text: Denver Kitchen Gardens was born from a desire to share the knowledge
  and expertise I have gained over the years as an avid home gardener and urban
  homesteader.
content_heading: Hi! I'm Jenny!
content_copy: >-
  I'm the founder and head gardener at Denver Kitchen Gardens. For more than a
  decade, I have been learning everything I can about growing fruits, veggies,
  flowers and herbs.


  I've worked on small-scale farms and have tended community garden plots. I've planted seeds in raised beds, patio planters and in greenhouses. I've grown potatoes on balconies and lettuce on windowsills. Although I've learned so much from my mentors, I've learned the most through trial and error, through my personal successes and failures.


  > The trouble with trial and error is how long it takes to get results!


  I moved to Colorado years ago with plenty of gardening know-how but none of it specific to the conditions in Denver. After my first few garden tragedies, I pondered why there weren't better resources for those of us on the Front Range. Sure there was plenty of information out there - maybe too much. It was overwhelming! I wanted to find a coach to help me before I got too far off track and some personal guidance on how to save time and money.


  I was never able to find that person so now, I hope to be that resource for others.


  Whether you've been growing a garden for years or don't know dirt from soil (there is a difference), I'm here to help! I teach organic and sustainable gardening methods that simplify your life. I specialize in high-density gardening so you can get more for your money and also offer food preservation workshops so you can enjoy the fruits of your bounty year-round.


  No matter what time of year it is, I can help you find solutions to your gardening problems and help you to create the garden (and cellar) of your dreams!
